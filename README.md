# Create A TODO App
## General Application
The user will use this app to 
1. Add TODO items to a list.
2. Edit and Delete items in the list.


## Backend
In the backend use Laravel.
1. Design the database.
2. Write CRUD APIs for the todo model.
3. Do validation on the incoming queries from the front-end.
5. **(optional)** If you like, you may add user management and authentication
    - Users use a form to sign up and sign in.
    - Each user can see the items posted by other users.
    - Each user can only edit/delete items posted by themselves.
6. **(optional)** If you like, you can have a set public/private button
 in front of each todo item, public todo items can also be edited/deleted by other users
7. **(optional)** Adding a Role-Permission mechanism for users have extra points. (e.g. a user may can 
    add todo but not edit it and another user may have all the permissions )



## Frontend
1. Simply use Blade to render plain HTML forms.
2. **(optional)** If you know any front-end technologies you may use it
 to render a better UI/UX experience.
  - You may use CSS to style the form.
  - Or you may use Bootstrap components.
  - Or you may use JQuery for posting the form, or doing validation on the client.
  - If you know React, Vue or Angular you can use them to create a reactive UI.
